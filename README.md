This project is built for educating people amidst the corona virus pandemic. We hope to enable virtual education for all using our website. We use natural language processing to achieve our purpose and bring the best possible education to the users. Online education has become the new norm and we feel that every individual deserves the best possible learning to meet their needs. So we developed a website that uses the latest technologies to give our users the best possible education.

We have 3 components to our portal:

#### 1. Key Points Generation:

Given a sufficiently long text by the user, we will condense it for them extracting only the useful information that is relevant to the article. The user can select the domain of the article such as historical (for social studies), financial, general sciences and general purpose articles.

#### 2. Mind Map Generation:

With any given text, we hope to generate a mind map that relates different entities in the document and give a visual representation for the same. This is for all those students who learn better visually and need maps and images.

#### 3. Question Generation:

Given a document, we are trying to generate simple questions that the user as a question bank to test their learning and see how well they have prepared. So after the user learns from the previous two modules, they can test themselves by questions generated automatically using natural language processing.
