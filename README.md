This project is built for educativing people amidst the corona virus pandemic. We hope to enable virtual education for all using our website. We use natural language processing to achieve our purpose and bring the best possible eduaction to the users.

We have 3 components to our portal:

#### 1. Summary Generation:

Given a sufficiently long text by the user, we will summarize it for them extracting only the useful information that is relevant to the article.

#### 2. Mind Map Generation:

With any given text, we hope to generate a mind map that relates different entities in the document and give a visual representation for the same.

#### 3. Question Generation:

Given a document, we are trying to generate simple questions that the user as a question bank to test their learning and see how well they have prepared.
